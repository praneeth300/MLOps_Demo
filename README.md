To help you write complete documentation for your `MLOps_Demo-main` project to include in a `README.md` file on GitHub, I’ll first need to inspect the contents of the ZIP file you uploaded.

I'll now extract and review the structure and contents of the `MLOps_Demo-main.zip` file.


Your project has a well-structured MLOps pipeline. Based on the contents, I’ll draft a comprehensive `README.md` suitable for GitHub. The documentation will include:

* Project Overview
* Directory Structure
* Features
* Getting Started
* Usage Instructions
* CI/CD Workflow
* Technologies Used
* Contribution
* License

# 🛠️ MLOps Demo Project

This project demonstrates a complete Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) workflow for building, training, registering, deploying, and monitoring a machine learning model using automation tools like GitHub Actions, Docker, and Streamlit.

## 🚀 Features

- End-to-end MLOps pipeline for a churn prediction model
- Data preprocessing and training
- Automated model and dataset registration
- Backend API for model serving (FastAPI/Flask)
- Frontend dashboard for predictions (Streamlit)
- Dockerized services for deployment
- CI/CD using GitHub Actions

---

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/MLOps_Demo-main.git
cd MLOps_Demo-main
````

### 2. Install dependencies

For global development:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or use individual environment setup for each component (`backend`, `frontend`, etc.)

---

## 🧪 Usage

### Run Data Preprocessing and Training

```bash
cd data_science/src
python prep.py
python train.py
python data_register.py
```

### Launch Backend (Model Serving)

```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

Or with Docker:

```bash
docker build -t churn-backend .
docker run -p 8000:8000 churn-backend
```

### Launch Frontend (UI)

```bash
cd frontend
streamlit run app.py
```

Or with Docker:

```bash
docker build -t churn-frontend .
docker run -p 8501:8501 churn-frontend
```

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/pipeline.yml`) that automates:

* Linting and testing
* Model training
* Docker build and push
* Deployment of backend and frontend

To activate, push to the main branch and ensure your secrets (e.g., DockerHub credentials) are set in GitHub.

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, scikit-learn
* Streamlit (Frontend)
* Flask/FastAPI (Backend)
* Docker
* GitHub Actions

## 🤝 Contribution

Feel free to fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request. Contributions to improve the pipeline or add new features are welcome!
